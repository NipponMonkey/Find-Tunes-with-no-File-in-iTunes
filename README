Find Tune with no File in iTunes

This is a little project written in Java that parses iTunes xml library and finds tunes that have broken links.

This is useful as it seems that iTunes gives no way for a user to quickly find these tunes.

This could be extended to change the xml library which should automatically get rid of the unwanted broken tunes. (No test this though)

This project was an excuse to use Java and GitHub a little more.
